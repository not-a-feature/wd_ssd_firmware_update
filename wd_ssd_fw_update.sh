# This script downloads and updates the firmware of Western Digital SSDs on Ubuntu / Linux Mint.
# It is only capable of updating, if, and only if the current firmware version is
# directly supported. If not, you have to upgrade to one of these versions first.

# The script assumes the SSD is at /dev/nvme0. Adjust accordingly if your SSD is located elsewhere.
# Firmware updates can be risky.
# Always back up your data and understand the risks before proceeding.
# Use at your own risk
